PROBLEM STATEMENT
•	Many libraries still manage seat reservations manually, leading to inefficiencies and inconvenience for both staff and patrons.The absence of a streamlined digital system result in several issues:
1.	Inefficient Seat Utilization: Without a proper tracking system, seats may remain underutilized or overbooked.
2.	Time-Consuming Processes: Both users and staff spend unnecessary time managing and coordinating seat reservations.
3.	Inaccurate Availability Information: Users may not have real-time information on seat availability, causing frustration and wasted trips.
4.	Limited Accessibility: Manual systems often lack the flexibility needed for users to make or modify reservations remotely.

PROJECT OVERVEIW
The Library Seat Reservation System is a web application developed to streamline the process of reserving library seats. Built using Java, MySQL, basic HTML, and Maven within IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, it serves both users and administrators : 

User Features:
•	Seat Availability Check: Users can view and select available seats.
•	Reservation: Reserve seats for specific hours.
•	Check-In/Check-Out: Manage reservations effectively.

Admin Features:
•	Reservation Management: View and manage all reservations.
•	Seat Maintenance: Cancel reservations for damaged seats.
•	User Management: Add new users to the system.

TECHINICAL STACKS USED FOR PROJECT 
•	Frontend Technologies : 
1.	HTML: For basic web design and structure.
2.	CSS: For styling the HTML pages.
3.	JavaScript: For interactive elements and validation.

•	Backend Technologies : 
1.	Java: The primary programming language for building the backend logic.
2.	Servlets & JSP: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
3.	JDBC: For connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.

•	Database Management System : 
1.	MySQL: The database management system for storing user information, seat details, and reservations.

•	Development Enviroment : 
1.	IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding, testing, and debugging the application.
2.	Eclipse 2024 : Eclipse is a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for Java development and other programming languages
3.	Maven: For project management and dependency handling.

•	Version Control : 
1.	Git & Github : a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and offers additional features to facilitate collaboration and code management

FUTURE ENCHANCEMENT
The Library Seat Reservation System holds significant promise for future enhancements to boost user experience and operational efficiency. Key areas of expansion include:

a.	Mobile Application Development:Creating mobile apps for Android and iOS to allow users to check seat availability, make reservations, and manage check-ins/check-outs on the go.
b.	Real-Time Seat Monitoring:Implementing IoT sensors to monitor seat occupancy in real-time, providing accurate, up-to-the-minute information on seat availability.
c.	QR Code Check-In/Check-Out: Integrating QR code technology for efficient and contactless check-in and check-out processes, making the system more user-friendly and faster.
d.	Integration with Campus Systems: Linking the reservation system with other campus systems like student portals, ID card systems, and event management platforms to provide a seamless and unified experience for users.
